# BlockChain

Use Hashlib to calculate the hash for all data
The first block is linked to 0
In other blocks , they are linked to their previous block's hash

***Time** Complexity:*
O(1) because we are adding blocks with statements

***Space** Complexity:*
O(n) since we need to store all blocks in blockchain list
