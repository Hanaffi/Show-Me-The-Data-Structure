# Union and Intersection

Union add all elements in list1 and list2 to a set which won't allow duplicate and then return a LinkedList of these element

For Intersection , I created set for elements. Then I appended them to a linked list.
***Time** Complexity:*
For both , O(n)  because we iterate only one time for each list
***Space** Complexity:*
O(n) for both ,  because we use one list to store the union values and intersection values
